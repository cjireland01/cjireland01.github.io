    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
    <p>Welcome! This ePortfolio showcases my work in Computer Science with a focus on <strong>software engineering</strong>.</p>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Cameron Ireland, and this website serves as my professional self-assessment. I earned my Bachelor&#8217s degree in Computer Science, <em>summa cum laude</em>, from Southern New Hampshire University in 2025. This work is the culmination of my years of progress in this field and showcases my ability for growth, as well as the technical skills I have gained throughout the program.</p>
        <p>Throughout my time in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire I have had to develop various skills that will prove invaluable in the professional field of computer science. Collaboration in a team environment was not my strong suit prior to this program, but throughout the various major projects that I&#8217ve completed and collaborated on, both in school and in personal projects, I can safely say this is one of my strongest characteristics. Furthering the communication aspect of my skillset, my ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders, especially non-technical stakeholders, has grown substantially during this program as well. I often find myself discussing complex topics with co-workers or friends who have no technical background and have increasingly been able to understand the workings of software, which translated well to coursework requirements.</p>
        <p>My overall skillset within software engineering itself has also grown exponentially, especially compared to the hobby projects and C# projects that I worked on before this program. Fundamental skills like Object Oriented Programming and Separation of Concerns are now hard-set into my way of thinking when it comes to programming. Trying to find an algorithm that can perform a function more efficiently always takes precedent over writing my own, and security has become a priority in all that I write.</p>
        <p>Overall, this program has given me the tools I need to enter the computer science world with a strong grasp on the foundational concepts and skills required to produce quality software, with the ability to become better.</p>
