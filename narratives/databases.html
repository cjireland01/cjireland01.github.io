      <h2>Original Artifact</h2>
      <p>
        The artifact selected for enhancement in this section remains the Inventory Management Application originally developed in October 2024. The initial implementation used a local SQLite database that could only store data on a single device. It did not support synchronization across multiple devices, lacked user authentication, and could not be used in environments with more than one warehouse or team member. This severely limited its real-world viability for businesses needing centralized or collaborative access.

      <h2>Enhancements</h2>
      <p>
        To address these limitations, I replaced the SQLite implementation with Firebase's Firestore cloud database. This transition introduced multi-device data synchronization, real-time updates, and support for user authentication and permission-based access. The system now supports sharding by location, allowing inventory to be stored and managed separately for each warehouse while still being visible to authorized users with administrative roles. This design allows each warehouse to operate independently while preserving centralized visibility and control for authorized personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firestore’s built-in user authentication system also eliminated the need for manual user handling in the app’s code. User credentials, access control, and secure password management are handled through Firebase Authentication, which stores passwords in an encrypted format. This significantly improves security and reduces the code complexity within the app. Overall, this enhancement transformed the application into a scalable, flexible, and commercially viable solution for distributed inventory management.
